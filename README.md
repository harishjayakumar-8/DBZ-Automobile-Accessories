## 👥 Team Collaboration

We are a team of **7 members**.

This project was started as a common team task, and all members worked collaboratively on:

- HTML page development  
- CSS styling and UI design  
- JavaScript logic implementation  
- Debugging and testing  

Instead of strictly separating roles, we supported each other across all technologies to complete the project successfully.
